\usage{
HMLE_TVC(
  init,
  df,
  status,
  hstr = NULL,
  dist = NULL,
  method = "Nelder-Mead",
  maxit = 100
)
}
\arguments{
\item{init}{: initial point for optimisation step
under the parameterisation (log(scale), log(shape1), log(shape2), beta) for scale-shape1-shape2 models or
(mu, log(scale), beta) for log-location scale models.}

\item{df}{A data frame in **long format**, containing one row per individual per
covariate-measurement time. Required columns:

* `ID` — individual identifier
* `time` — time at which the covariates are measured
* `des*` — covariate columns used in the model (e.g., `des1`, `des2`, …)

The last row for each ID represents the individual's event/censoring time,
even if the event time does not coincide with a measurement time.}

\item{status}{vector of event indicators (1 = event at the final time; 0 = censored)}

\item{hstr}{Hazard structure ("PH" or "AFT")}

\item{dist}{: distribution for the baseline hazard:
Power Generalised Weibull ("PGW")
Generalised Gamma ("GenGamma"))
Exponentiated Weibull ("EW")
Weibull ("Weibull")
Gamma ("Gamma")
LogNormal ("LogNormal")
LogLogistic ("LogLogistic")}

\item{method}{Optimisation method for the likelihood.
Either `"nlminb"` or a valid `optim()` method.}

\item{maxit}{Maximum number of optimisation iterations.}
}
\value{
A list containing:

* The full output from `optim()` or `nlminb()`
* The **negative log-likelihood function** used for optimisation
* A vector giving, for each ID, the cumulative hazard increments used in the likelihood

Returned invisibly where appropriate.
}
\description{
`HMLE_TVC()` fits parametric survival models in the presence of
**time-varying covariates**, using maximum likelihood estimation.

The function supports:

* **Proportional Hazards (PH)** models with time-varying covariates
* Fully parametric baseline hazards (2-parameter or 3-parameter)

* **Accelerated Failure Time (AFT)** models with time-varying covariates
* Fully parametric baseline hazards (2-parameter or 3-parameter)

The likelihood is constructed from the cumulative hazard differences across
observation intervals for each individual, using a counting-process representation.

For each individual, the data must contain several rows:
one per time-varying covariate measurement, along with the corresponding time.
}
\details{
## Likelihood formulation for PH models

For each individual \(i\), let
\(t_{i1} < t_{i2} < \cdots < t_{iK_i}\)
denote the *observation / measurement times*.

The cumulative hazard contribution over interval \((t_{ij-1}, t_{ij})\) is:

\deqn{
\Delta H_{ij}
  = \left[ H_0(t_{ij}) - H_0(t_{ij-1}) \right]
    \exp(x_{ij}^\top \beta),
}

where \(x_{ij}\) is the vector of covariates measured at time \(t_{ij}\).

The full log-likelihood is:

\deqn{
\ell = \sum_i \left(
  - \sum_j \Delta H_{ij}
  + \delta_i \log \left[
       h_0(T_i) \exp(x_{iK}^\top \beta)
    \right]
\right),
}

where:

* \(\Delta H_{ij}\) comes from cumulative hazard increments
* \(T_i = t_{iK}\) is the final event or censoring time
* \(\delta_i\) is the event indicator
* hazard and cumulative hazard are computed based on `dist`

The function internally:
1. Splits the data by ID
2. Computes cumulative hazard at all measurement times
3. Computes increments \(\Delta H_{ij}\) for each ID
4. Constructs the likelihood
5. Optimises over \(\beta\) and baseline parameters
}
\section{Data structure}{

The input data frame must contain:

* varying number of rows per ID
* strictly increasing `time` within each ID
* last row containing the event/censoring time

Covariates must be named as `des1`, `des2`, etc.
